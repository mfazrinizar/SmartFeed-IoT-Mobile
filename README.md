## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DSC-UNSRI/Secure-MVC-Flutter-Firebase-Example.git
cd Secure-MVC-Flutter-Firebase-Example
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure Gradle Properties

- Open `android/gradle.properties`
- Delete the line `org.gradle.java.home=value` or change with your defined Java Home Path.

### 4. Configure Firebase

- Download and install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (you may use npm or use standalone package).
- Make sure `firebase` command is recognized (run in CMD). If not, make sure to have the firebase tools defined in environment variable path.
- Navigate to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and click `Create a Firebase project`. Then, just follow the instructions.
- After created, navigate to `Overview` and click `Add App > Android`. Then, just follow the instructions (make sure the Android package name is the same as your `android/app/build.gradle` applicationId).
- After Android app created in Firebase Console, navigate to `Overview` and click `Build > Authentication` and `Build > Firestore Database` (just follow the instructions on creation, choose the closest server with your country (e.g. Jakarta), use Test Mode Rules at the moment).
- Back to your IDE or Code Editor, open up terminal and run `firebase login` (just follow the instructions to login your Google Account [use the same as your Firebase Account]).
- After successfully logged in, change `lib/firebase_options.dart` to `lib/firebase_options.dart.backup` and run `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli` then `flutterfire configure --project=YOUR-FIREBASE-PROJECT-ID` (configure only for Android and iOS, use Space to disable other platforms). It will generate and replace `lib/firebase_options.dart`.

### 5. Generate Encrypted Environment Keys

- Add all `FirebaseOptions android` values inside `lib/firebase_options.dart` to `.env`. Look at the this original repository `lib/firebase_options.dart` (before you replace it using flutterfire configure) to modify and proceed (don't push API keys to source control, bud).
- Run `dart run build_runner build --define flutter_secure_dotenv_generator:flutter_secure_dotenv=OUTPUT_FILE=encryption_key.json`.
- Change `.vscode/launch.json` `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `IV_KEY` based on generated `encryption_key.json` (root-level folder).
- Use `Run and Debug` (CTRL + SHIFT + D) feature and debug the app using your favorite Android emulator or via USB debugging.
